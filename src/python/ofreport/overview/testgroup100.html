<p>Test group 100 checks for all possible error messages as mentioned in the spec.</p>
<b>Special cases:</b>
<p>Error messages pose some specific testing challenges. Some devices might never enter the state that triggers the error condition (e.g, soft switches might have unlimited tables, be able to simulate unlimited port numbers). Permission errors involve an entity outside the switch's openflow implementation, and are optional test cases. All queue related error messages are optional. All emergency mode related error messages are optional.</p>

<b>Profiles:</b>
<p>All profiles have to pass all tests except</br>
