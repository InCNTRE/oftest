Notes: An OpenFlow switch is required to match the type in both standard Ethernet and 802.2 with a SNAP header and OUI of 0x000000. The special value of 0x05FF is used to match all 802.3 packets without SNAP headers. 
To handle the various Ethernet framing types, matching the Ethernet type is handled in a slightly different manner. If the packet is an Ethernet II frame, the Ethernet type is handled in the expected way. If the packet is an 802.3 frame with a SNAP header and Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) of 0x000000, the SNAP protocol id is matched against the flows Ethernet type. A flow entry that specifies an Ethernet type of 0x05FF, matches all Ethernet 802.2 frames without a SNAP header and those with SNAP headers that do not have an OUI of 0x000000."

Test Suite 70: Actions 
Test suite 70 tests all the data plane actions a switch can support. The test suite contains tests for nine forwarding actions (70.30 to 70.110) and eleven header field write actions (70.120 to 70.230).  
 
The OpenFlow Switch 1.0 Specification does not clarify what is considered an illegal action order. Due to this ambiguity, what is considered an illegal action order may vary based on the implementation. While it seems reasonable to consider a header modify action with no subsequent output or forward action as an illegal ordering, we have left tests 70.240 and 70.250 as OPTIONAL. 
 
Special cases: 
 
The following Forwarding actions are required: 
All: 70.30 
Controller:70.40 
Table:70.60 
In_port:70.70

Test Title 
Data plane / Actions / Sequential execution 
Test Purpose 
Verify correct execution of sequential actions  
Specification Reference 
OpenFlow Switch Specification 1.0.0, 4.6 Flow Table Modification messages, p. 13.  
Action lists for inserted flow entries MUST be processed in the order specified. However, there is no packet output ordering guaranteed within a port. For example, an action list may result in two packets sent to two different VLANs on a single port. These two packets may be arbitrarily re-ordered, but the packet bodies must match those generated from a sequential execution of the actions 
Profile Status 
OPTIONAL 
Requirements 
Correct implementation of sequential execution 
Topology

At least two data plane ports connections to DUT. 
Methodology 
Configure and connect the Primary-controller on the DUT. Create a flow with two OFPAT_SET_VLAN_VID actions (set to two different VLAN IDs) followed by two OFPAT_OUTPUT actions (set to two different egress ports). Send matching packet to ingress port. Verify the packets sent out both egress ports contain the second VLAN ID.
